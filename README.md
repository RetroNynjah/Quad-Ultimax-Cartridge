# Quad Ultimax Cartridge
Eagle schematic and board for a C64 Ultimax cartridge with two-bit ROM selector DIP switch (or jumpers). It's based on a 27256 type EPROM.
The cartridge can fit four 64Kbit (8KB) Ultimax ROM images.
Combine several 8KB ROM files into one bigger file before burning EPROM.
The DIP switch (or jumpers) is optional. Leave it out if all you need is one 8KB ROM.
Gerber files and 3D-printable enclosure included.
